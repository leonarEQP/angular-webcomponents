# Angular & Web Components

This project is about the creation of a component in angular to be imported in a flat html (web component).

## Requeriments

Angular 15.2.0<br>

Angular Elements 15.2.9<br>

To install these specific versions of Angular and Angular elements we must have installed the Node Version Manager NVM that allows us to have several versions of node installed. It is not the purpose of this project to teach the steps to follow but I leave the reference links I used.
